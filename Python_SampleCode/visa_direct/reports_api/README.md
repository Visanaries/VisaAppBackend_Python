# Reports API
The Reports API provides reporting capabilities such as transaction reconciliation data API. The data needed for reconciliation includes both push(OCT) and pull(AFT) transaction details and any exceptions such as chargebacks & reversals. This data allows you to reconcile the transactions sent by your systems with what was processed through VisaNet.<br> <br> <b>Note: This functionality is currently available for US transactions ONLY.</b>

- API version: 1.0
- Package version: 1.0.0

## Tests
- Edit the file **globlaConfig.py** to set the fields shown below. Please refer the [Getting Started Guide](https://developer.visa.com/vdpguide#get-started-overview) to get the credentials.

```python
# For mutual auth
userName = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'
certificatePath = '/absolute/path/to/cert.pem'
privateKeyPath = '/absolute/path/to/key_xxxx.pem'
caCertPath = '/absolute/path/to/cacert.pem'

# For MLE also set the following fields
mleKeyId = 'your_keyId'
encryptionPublicKeyPath = 'your_encryption_public_key_path'
self.decryptionPrivateKeyPath = 'your_decryption_private_key_path'

# For x-pay token
apiKey = 'your_apiKey'
sharedSecret = 'your_shared_secret'

# For Proxy
proxyUrl = 'proxy_url'

```
To run the unit tests:
- Note: The data in the unit tests are just placeholders. Please refer the [Create Project Guide](https://developer.visa.com/pages/working-with-visa-apis/create-project) to get the test data

nosetests --nocapture
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
from src.apis.reports_api_api import ReportsApiApi
from src.configuration import Configuration

config = Configuration()
# Uncomment this block to enable proxy
# config.proxy_url = 'PROXY_URL'

# Configure HTTP basic authorization: basicAuth
config.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
config.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
config.cert_file = 'ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CERT_FILE'
config.key_file = 'ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_KEY_FILE'
config.ssl_ca_cert = 'ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CA_CERT_FILE'

# Unblock this block to configure MLE credentials
# config.api_key['keyId'] = 'YOUR_KEY_ID'
# config.encryption_public_key_path = 'ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_MLE_CERT_FILE'
# config.decryption_private_key_path = 'ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_MLE_KEY_FILE'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = ReportsApiApi()

# Set all the required parameters in the getreporting_api. Look at the documentation for further clarification.
from_date = 'from_date_example' # str | The beginning date. Example: 31032016 for 31st March 2016.
to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | The end date. Example: 03042016 for 3rd April 2016. Currently, only upto 5 days worth of data can be retrieved.  Also, only the last 120 days of data can be searched from the current date.
fields = 'fields_example' # str | Required additional fields. Example: Add fields like amountInTransactionCurrency, currencyConversionRate,   reasonCodeValue, cardType, networkId, transactionStateCode, businessApplicationId, separated by comma. (optional)
offset = 'offset_example' # str | This determines the page number for the pagination. Defalut is set to 1. (optional)
limit = 'limit_example' # str | Total number of records that should be present in each page. Defalut is set to 100. (optional)

try:
    api_response = api_instance.getreporting_api(from_date, to_date, fields=fields, offset=offset, limit=limit)
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling ReportsApiApi->getreporting_api: %s\n" % e)
```
